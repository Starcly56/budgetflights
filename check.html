	  <h1>CHECK-IN</h1>
<p>At Budget Flights, we offer several options to enable our passengers to complete their check-in procedures quickly and without any problems.</p> 
<p>You, too, can enjoy trouble-free check-in, either in the airport at our check-in desk or self-service desks, on our website using your computer, tablet, or smartphone, or using our mobile app.</p>

<h2>Check-in desk</h2>
<p>Just as you can check in using one of our online facilities, you can also experience a trouble-free and speedy check-in at one of our airport check-in desks using the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the Budget Flights check-in desk at the airport. Here you will meet our ground services staff.</li>
<li>Show all your travel documents such as ID and passport to our check-in desk staff along with any other documents relating to special circumstances, for example doctorâ€™s notes. 
Passengers who have bought discount tickets must at this point show the documentation that qualifies them for the discount to our staff.</li>
<li>If there are no issues with your documents, our staff will check your baggage and take it from you. 
If you have exceeded your baggage allowance, excess baggage procedures will be applied. For more detailed information, please look at the table below for knowing more about excess baggage allowance.</li>
<li>Once your baggage has been processed, our staff will give you your boarding pass and direct you to your boarding gate.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Online check-in</h2>
<p>If you have already checked in online, you can save time by going straight to the online check-in desk without having to wait in the line at the other counters and just hand in your baggage. 
If you check in online using our website or mobile app, you can send your mobile boarding pass to your telephone. When you check in online using our website, you can also get a printout of your online boarding pass. 
As check-in options may vary according to airport, we recommend that you read through check-in options at airports.</p>

there is no need to worry. You can take advantage of our excess baggage tariffs and enjoy the benefits of traveling with Budget Flights.
